00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Deep in the center of our galaxy, a mysterious cluster of stars is defying explanation.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:20,100
They zip around a supermassive black hole at incredible speeds, reaching nearly 10% the speed of light.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's surprising to find any stars here at all, as the black hole shreds apart the gas clouds they're born from.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So these stars must be older ones that came here from elsewhere.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But here's the mystery.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They appear much younger than expected, as if they've found a way to cheat death.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A new theory proposes a mind-bending explanation that could rewrite our understanding of stellar evolution.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
These stars could be feeding off dark matter, powered indefinitely by the most mysterious substance in the universe.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The nature of dark matter remains a total mystery.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Despite making up 85% of all material in the universe, it's completely invisible to light, and only interacts with visible matter through its gravitational effects.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It holds galaxies together like glue, and provides a kind of scaffolding for the entire universe.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Studying dark matter is next to impossible.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But some theories predict that just like matter and antimatter, dark matter particles may annihilate each other when they collide.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the process, energy and other particles like photons may be released, which could become a source of power.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:52,000
These collisions would probably only occur where dark matter is most dense, which happens to be right where those mysterious stars live, at the very center of our galaxy.

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As these youthful stars zip around the galactic core, they sail through ultra-dense clouds of dark matter, sucking in dark particles, and potentially triggering collisions inside.

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
These collisions could be acting as an extra energy source within the stars, making them appear mysteriously young.

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Immortal suns feeding off a cosmic fountain of youth.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If this is the case, it would open a whole new pathway for the life cycle of stars.

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Milky Way's core emits a strange, unexplained glow that was discovered in 2009.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Some believe that dark matter annihilation could be causing the excess radiation.

22
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And strange, puffy G-objects have also been found near the galaxy's core.

23
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They appear like stars surrounded by clouds of gas, but it may be that their outer layers have been puffed out by dark matter collisions inside.

24
00:04:41,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In theory, some of these dark particles may be comprised of a variety of different particles, obeying their own unique chemistry.

25
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In theory, some of these dark particles could even organize into forms of dark life.

26
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Dark matter beings may be surrounding us right now.

27
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Perhaps they could even be sending signals through dark matter collisions.

28
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Messages from a shadow world.

29
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It may still be that dark matter does not exist at all, and the anomalies we see are explained by something else.

30
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But by studying the immortal stars at our galaxy's core, we may begin to uncover the secrets of the shadow world,

31
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and glimpse a piece of the universe that light has never touched.

32
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In theory, some of these dark particles could even organize into forms of light that light does not exist at all,

33
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and the anomalies we see are explained by something else.

34
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In theory, some of these dark particles could even organize into forms of light that light does not exist at all,

35
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and the anomalies we see are explained by something else.

36
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you for watching.
